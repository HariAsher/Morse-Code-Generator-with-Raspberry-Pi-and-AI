# Morse-Code-Generator-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-AI
This repository showcases a Raspberry Pi-based Morse Code Generator with the help of AI. It allows users to input text messages, which the program converts into Morse code. The Morse code is visually represented through an LED blinking sequence and audibly represented using a buzzer.
